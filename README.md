# Everyone Needs Address Validation
This project was designed and developed by InfoSourcing Inc www.Info-Sourcing.com for Acumatica Hackathon 2017 Summit and we had good time with Acumatica folks and partners brainstorming and putting together this solution along with Nayan Mansinha

If you want to extend this project to tap into address validation built into Acumatica via Avalara then you can tweak to bypass Avalara and use USPS to validate address, saves few extra dollars by using this piece of code.
